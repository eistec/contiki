Bootloader
----------------------------------------------
The bootloader installs as a standalone application like any other application.

When the bootloader is installed the node will always boot into the bootloader first.
The bootloader checks if a valid user application is installed and that a flag to
indicate bootup of the user application is set. If these conditions are met, the
bootloader starts the user application. Else the bootloader startsup the radio
with a CoAP interface to upload a new application.

The bootloader is flashed to the mote as any other application.

##### CoAP Upload
Upload of a new application is done through the "bootloader/upload" service and a bootup of
the user application is done with a PUT to the "bootloader/run" service with the char '1'.

A bootloader application image is made by making target <PROJECT>.i, eg:
$ make TARGET=mulle hello-world.i

If an application image should be flashed through a debugger use the extension .if.mulle as the FILENAME, eg:
$ make TARGET=mulle flash FILENAME=hello-world.if.mulle
The application will automatically boot if the flag "boot into application" is set in the bootloader.
If the flag is not set do a PUT of "1" through CoAP interface "bootloader/run".
NOTE: The bootloader program ( this program located in this folder) must be flashed into the mote also through
the standard flashing procedure.

To boot into the bootloader again from the user application one can call
bootloader_run() (bootloader_api.h). The application coap-bootloader can also be used to
go into the bootloader through a CoAP interface.

The file format of the image is
4 bytes size : This is the size of the data including application data and checksums
512 bytes application + 2 bytes crc : This sequence is repeated, note that last
                                      block can be less than 512 bytes but 2 bytes crc
                                      is always present.



See make_image.py for crc calculation. All data is written least significant byte first.
//TODO(henrik) Include start address of the image to prevent wiring of images to wrong
               address.
